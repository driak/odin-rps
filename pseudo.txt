random number: 1 or 2 or 3

multiple random number between 0 and 1 by max number we want to show (for example: 0.5723 * 3). This will ensurewe have the random component inside, but it's not enough because what we want is 1 or 2 or 3, so we will give an equal space of probability for each number but we don't want the space, we want the number so we floor it
